== ST SPEAr SoC HDLC controller ==

SPEAr family SoC provides two kinds of HDLC controller:
1. TDM/E1 HDLC controller 
2. RS485 HDLC controllers.

Both of them use similar DMA descriptor structure, similar interrupt
queue and so on. So both share the same driver code in Linux.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of:
  - "st,tdm_hdlc"
  - "st,rs485_hdlc"
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
  services interrupts for this device.
- interrupt: Should contain the tdm or rs485 interrupt number

TDM optional properties:
-ip_type: SPEAr310 and SPEAr1310 have different configuration of HDLC
-nr_channel: number of logical channels on this port.
-nr_timeslot: number of timeslot actually using.
-tx_falling_edge: tx edge option
-rx_rising_edge: rx edge option
-ts0_delay: delay between SYNC and beginning of TS0

RS485 optional properties:
-tx_falling_edge: tx edge option
-rx_rising_edge: rx edge option
-cts_enable: CSMA enable or not
-cts_delay: CTS delay
