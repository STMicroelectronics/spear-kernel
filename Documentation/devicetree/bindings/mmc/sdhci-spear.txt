* SPEAr SDHCI Controller

Required properties:
- compatible : "st,spear-sdhci"
- reg : Address range of the sdhci registers
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- interrupt: Should contain the sdhci interrupt number

Optional Properties:
- power-gpio: specifies the power gpio pin with flags: active low:1, active
  high:0
- int-gpio: card detect interrupt gpio, with zero flags.

  If your board don't support these gpios then don't pass the entry.

- power_always_enb: power should be on before inserting the card and so can't be
  switched off. Only valid when power gpio is supported.

Example:

	sdhci@fc000000 {
		compatible = "st,spear-sdhci";
		reg = <0xfc000000 0x1000>;

		power-gpio = <&gpio0 5 0>
		int-gpio = <&gpio0 6 0>
		power_always_enb;
	};
