* FSMC NAND

Required properties:
- compatible : "st,spear600-fsmc-nand"
- reg : Address range of the mtd chip
- reg-names: Should contain the reg names "fsmc_regs" and "nand_data"
- st,ale-off : Chip specific offset to ALE
- st,cle-off : Chip specific offset to CLE
- maxbanks: Number of banks supported by SoC

Optional properties:
- bank-width : Width (in bytes) of the device.  If not present, the width
  defaults to 1 byte
- nand-skip-bbtscan: Indicates the the BBT scanning should be skipped

- nand-timings-enabled: Indicates if the timing parameters are passed
  via DT
- nand-timings,tclr:
- nand-timings,tar:
- nand-timings,thiz:
- nand-timings,thold:
- nand-timings,twait:
- nand-timings,tset: All these timing parameters come from the actual
  nand device specification. Each of this represents a number of time
  period of hclk ie a number 4 in thold with hclk = 166MHz means that
  thold = (1000 / 166) * 4 ns = 24.09ns

- st,ready-busy: Should contain either of "rb-gpio" or "rb-wait". When
  this property is not defined, the default is to use rb-wait.
- st,rb-gpios: When the st,ready-busy is defined as "rb-gpio", a gpio
  pin number is defined in this property

- nand-erasesize: Pass erasesize of the connected NAND device
- nand-writesize: Pass writesize of the connected NAND device
- nand-oobsize: Pass oobsize of the connected NAND device
- nand-sw-ecc: boolean indicating whether s/w ecc is supported

Example:

	fsmc: flash@d1800000 {
		compatible = "st,spear600-fsmc-nand";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0xd1800000 0x1000	/* FSMC Register */
		       0xd2000000 0x4000>;	/* NAND Base */
		reg-names = "fsmc_regs", "nand_data";
		st,ale-off = <0x20000>;
		st,cle-off = <0x10000>;
		maxbanks = <1>;

		nand-timings-enabled;
		nand-timings,tclr = <1>;
		nand-timings,tar = <1>;
		nand-timings,thiz = <1>;
		nand-timings,thold = <4>;
		nand-timings,twait = <6>;
		nand-timings,tset = <0>;

		bank-width = <1>;
		nand-skip-bbtscan;

		partition@0 {
			...
		};
	};
