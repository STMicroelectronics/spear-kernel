* Synopsys DesignWare I2C

Required properties :

 - compatible : should be "snps,designware-i2c"
 - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
 - interrupts : <IRQ> where IRQ is the interrupt number.

Recommended properties :

 - clock-frequency : desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.

Optional properties :
 - stop-control : boolean value which suggests that the controller has
 been configured with 'IC_EMPTYFIFO_HOLD_MASTER_EN' option, meaning that
 s/w needs to write command to generate stop with the last byte of
 transfer.

Example :

	i2c@f0000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "snps,designware-i2c";
		reg = <0xf0000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <11>;
		stop-control;
		clock-frequency = <400000>;
	};
