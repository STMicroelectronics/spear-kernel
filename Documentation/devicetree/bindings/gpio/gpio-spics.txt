=== SPI CS Driver ===

SPEAr platform provides a provision to control chipselects of ARM PL022
Prime Cell spi controller through its system registers, which otherwise
remains under PL022 control. If chipselect remain under PL022 control
then they would be released as soon as transfer is over and TxFIFO
becomes empty. This is not desired by some of the device protocols above
spi which expect (multiple) transfers without releasing their chipselects.

Chipselects can be controlled by software by turning them as GPIOs.
SPEAr provides another interface through system registers through which
software can directly control each PL022 chipselect. Hence, it is
natural for SPEAr to export the control of this interface as gpio. 


Required properties:

  * compatible: should be defined as "st,spear-spics-gpio"
  * st-spics,peripcfg-reg: peripheral configuration register offset
  * st-spics,sw-enable-bit: bit offset to enable sw control
  * st-spics,cs-value-bit: bit offset to drive chipselect low or high
  * st-spics,cs-enable-mask: chip select number bit mask
  * st-spics,cs-enable-shift: chip select number program offset
  * gpio-controller: Marks the device node as gpio controller
  * #gpio-cells: should be 2

All the above bit offsets are within peripcfg register.
