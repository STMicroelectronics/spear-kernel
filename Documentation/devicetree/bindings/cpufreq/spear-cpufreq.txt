SPEAr cpufreq driver

It is a SPEAr SOC cpufreq driver for CPU0 frequency management.  It
supports both uniprocessor (UP) and symmetric multiprocessor (SMP)
systems which share clock across all CPUs.

Both required and optional properties listed below must be defined
under node /cpus/cpu@0.

Required properties:
- operating-freqs: Range of frequencies CPU could be transitioned into
, in the increasing order. 

Optional properties:
- clock-latency: Specify the possible maximum transition latency for clock,
  in unit of nanoseconds.

Examples:

cpus {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	cpu@0 {
		compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
		reg = <0>;
		next-level-cache = <&L2>;
		operating-freqs = <
			/* kHz */
			333000
			500000
			600000
		>;
		clock-latency = <61036>; /* two CLK32 periods */
	};

	cpu@1 {
		compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
		reg = <1>;
		next-level-cache = <&L2>;
	};

	cpu@2 {
		compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
		reg = <2>;
		next-level-cache = <&L2>;
	};

	cpu@3 {
		compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
		reg = <3>;
		next-level-cache = <&L2>;
	};
};
