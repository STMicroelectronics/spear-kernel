* STMicroelectronics L3G4200D Gyroscope

Required properties:
- compatible : "st,l3g4200d_gyro"
- reg : the I2C address of L3G4200D
- poll_interval : The polling interval (in ms)
- min_interval : Minimum permitted polling interval
  The value for minimum poll interval should be 2.
- axis_map_x : Used to map the x axis to some other plane of reference.
  The value shall be between 0 to 2.
- axis_map_y : Used to map the x axis to some other plane of reference
  The value shall be between 0 to 2.
- axis_map_z : Used to map the x axis to some other plane of reference
  The value shall be between 0 to 2.

Optional properties:
- negate_x, _y, _z: flags to negate the output of x, y, z registers.
  Only 0 and 1 is allowed for negation boolean flag.

Example:

Gyroscope:l3g4200d_gyro@69 {
			compatible = "st,l3g4200d_gyro";
			reg = <0x69>;
			poll_interval = <5>;
			min_interval = <2>;
			axis_map_x = <0>;
			axis_map_y = <1>;
			axis_map_z = <2>;
};
